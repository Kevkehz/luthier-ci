# About the documentation source files

This is the source of the project [documentation](https://luthier-ci.ingenia.me/en/docs) available in our official website. At the beginning of each file there are two special lines containing metadata used by our dynamic documentation library, [SimpleDocs](https://github.com/andersonsalas/simpledocs).
